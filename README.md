SQl analysis of weather data

## Overview
The goal of this analysis is to summarize temparature statistics in Oahu during peak tourism months of June and December. The ultimate question -- will a surf and ice cream shop have sufficient demand to be profitable year-round, even during the potentially extreme weather in June and December. This study will be an aid to investors can use the findings and confidently invest in a surf and ice cream shop.

## Results
Key Differences between June and December temperatures in Oahu:

* The June average temperature (~75) is around 4 degrees warmer than December's average (~71). This ~4-degree difference is observed at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles as well.
* The degree to which temperature varies is comparable between the months, as the standard deviation is around 3.5 degrees for both months. Generally speaking, this seems low in comparison to other parts of the globe, which may experience more severe shifts in weather.
* Though maximum and minimum temperatures are by nature somewhat of an outlier measure, it is notable that December's minimum (56) is nearly 10 degrees lower than June's (64).

## Summary
This analysis' findings indicate that Oahu is temperate in June and December, with averages in the low-to-mid 70s. Because of this temperate weather, there should be enough demand year-round for surf and ice cream. If we wished to investigate this query further, outlined below are two ways we could do so.

* **Precipitation**: While the temperature may not vary considerably, it would be prudent to analyze precipitation. Rainfall may greatly vary over June and December which may impact the profitability of a surf-ice cream shop. 
* **Year-Round Seasonal Data**: If the surf-ice cream shop would like to be profitable year-round, it would be in their best interest to analyze all the months/seasons temperature, instead of just June and December. This will give investors a better idea of demand and success of the business.
